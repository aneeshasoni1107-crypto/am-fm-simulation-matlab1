# AM and FM Signal Simulation & Demodulation using MATLAB

This project simulates **Amplitude Modulation (AM)** and **Frequency Modulation (FM)** signals using MATLAB. It also performs **demodulation** using envelope detection and phase differentiation.

## 📌 Features

- Generation of AM and FM signals
- Time-domain and frequency-domain plots
- AM demodulation using envelope detection + low-pass filter
- FM demodulation using phase differentiation
- Clean and commented MATLAB code

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- MATLAB (no special toolbox needed)
- Signal Processing
- FFT, Butterworth filter, Hilbert transform

## 📈 Output Snapshots

*(Add your own screenshots here if possible)*

## 📁 Files

- `modulation_demodulation.m` – Main MATLAB script
- `screenshot1.png` – Time-domain signals
- `screenshot2.png` – Frequency-domain plots (optional)

## ✅ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB or MATLAB Online.
2. Paste the code in a new script file (e.g., `modulation_demodulation.m`).
3. Run the script to see all outputs.
